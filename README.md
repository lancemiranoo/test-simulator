# üí°üß† TestGenius: Your Test Simulator üìù

The purpose of this project is to revolutionize the way students prepare for exams. We understand the stress and pressure that comes with test-taking, which became our motivation in developing a cutting-edge test simulator to ease students' worries and boost their confidence. First, consolidate the Q&As for the topic you want to study. And with just a simple click of a button, you can expect an output that dives you into a customized study session where you get to choose how many questions you want to practice. It's not just about answering questions though ‚Äì it will also output an immediate feedback to display a sense of progress. Answer right, and you'll get a virtual high-five; get it wrong, and it's a gentle nudge in the right direction. At the end, the program will output your practice test results and percentage. Perfect for prepping for exams and also turning study time into fun time.
